I'm beginning to tweet in Slovak, instead of English ([see previous post](http://laki.posterous.com/new-twitter-language)), and I decided to change my username too.

The reasons are much more personal and subjective this time. I don't mind using my real name as my username, but there are two problems with it:

1. I registered my account as @JanLakatos, with capital letters, which I disliked and changed it to @janlakatos later. Twitter [ignores the change](https://twitter.com/#search?q=janlakatos) though and shows my username in search results with capital letters. They promised a fix in the new API, but it's been bugging me for around 10 months and nothing's changed.
2. On twitter, the shorter the username is, the better. I myself hate replying to someone with a @reallylongusername because it limits me in character count. And replying to my current username means -12 characters.
3. The third reason is not really a reason, more like an explanation. I wanted to use my name as my username, in a shorter form though. But @[lakatos](https://twitter.com/lakatos) or @[jlakatos](https://twitter.com/jlakatos) were already taken. So was @[laki](https://twitter.com/laki), a nickname some people know me by in real life too. But then I came up with the idea of reversing my surname and BAM! there it was. @[sotakal](https://twitter.com/sotakal) is shorter than @[janlakatos](https://twitter.com/janlakatos), it kind of contains my real name and it seems quite original to me too.

I didn't want to create a new account to start tweeting in Slovak, I'd feel sorry about the 2000 archived tweets of mine, but a new username might be a just the thing to differentiate my English tweets from the Slovak ones.

That's it, thanks for reading and see you at @[sotakal](https://twitter.com/sotakal)!
