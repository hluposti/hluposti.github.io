[Kick-Ass](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/)'s R-rated “Hit Girl trailer” kicks ass. That's a fact. Especially the insane end with that crazy music playing in the background is something indescribable. See for yourself:

You like it, don't you?

The thing is that the music starting at 0:48 sounded very familiar when I heard it for the first time, and I couldn't remember when did I know it from. After a while of googling I found out it's from a child show called “[Banana Splits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYUZFhLD8RY)”. Do you remember it? Because I do.

I used to watch this show every single afternoon when I was around 6. It was aired on Cartoon Network in English and I couldn't understand a word of it back then, but the theme song lived on in my subconscious for all those years… Here it is:

It feels good to rediscover things like this.

P.S. The song from the trailer is “[Banana Splits (Tra La La Song)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flMS2gHFOH0)” by [The Dickies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dickies).
