You like it, don't you?

The thing is that the music starting at 0:48 sounded very familiar when I heard it for the first time, and I couldn't remember when did I know it from. After a while of googling I found out it's from a child show called “[Banana Splits][4]”. Do you remember it? Because I do.

I used to watch this show every single afternoon when I was around 6. It was aired on Cartoon Network in English and I couldn't understand a word of it back then, but the theme song lived on in my subconscious for all those years… Here it is:
