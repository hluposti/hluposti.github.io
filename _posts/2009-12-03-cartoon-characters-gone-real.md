Looking for an image on my hard drive led me to find the following images in various folders, images depicting our beloved cartoon characters in a more realistic way:

In the gallery below you can see **Inspector Gadget**, one of my childhood heroes, **Calvin and Hobbes**, the favorite comic pair (their reality version is simply awesome!) and also **Winnie the Pooh**, my most beloved Disney cartoon (probably that's why I find it so friggin' disturbing).

P.S. Although I know that you're likely to do it just because I told you not to, I'm going to warn you anyway: **Do not google any images with your favorite childhood characters with your SafeSearch turned off!** [Rule #34][2] can be very harsh and certain things cannot be unseen. I don't think I'll ever see Penny from Inspector Gadget in the same way as I did until today.
