Yesterday I saw [Constantine][2] for the second time and although it was dubbed in Czech (I hate dubbing generally) it was even more awesome than when I saw it last time.

But I watched in a bus, on my way back to the college and due to some bus issues a footage of about 5 minutes was skipped and of course that those five minutes were important to the story. So now I must get myself a copy of that movie and watch it again. And although I hate watching the same movies again during some short periods of time, I'm really looking forward to see this one.
