Dear fellow readers,  
I was forced to change the theme because of the ugly font used in the theme called "Neat!" I used until now.

I'm not sure if the font has been changed recently or if it has always been used that way and I only did something with my browser settings and it changed itself only on my computer, but the point is that the font looked ugly and I wanted to get rid off it.

The new theme was chosen because I like its darkness, because I like its simplicity and because its font looks good. I hope you'll like it too.

Thanks for all your visits.

Yours sincerely,  
Dr. Horrible
