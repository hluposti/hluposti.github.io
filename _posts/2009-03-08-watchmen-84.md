**_From a "haven't read the comic book" point of view…_**

![][pic1]

In 1977, Watchmen, a group of superheroes previously formed by the American governmant, is dismissed. Two of them – a godlike character called Doctor Manhattan and a cynical fiend called the Comedian – continue to work for the Government, especially during the Vietnam War; another Watchman called Rorschach continues to fight crime as an outlaw and the rest of the superheroes retires. On October 12th, 1985 the Comedian is murdered and Rorschach begins to investigate this. He is afraid that someone might be trying to kill all the Watchmen, so he decides to visit his old co-workers to warn them.

[Watchmen][2] have been recognized as the best graphic novel of all time. And with this kind of status, it was inevitable to avoid a film adaptation at some point. Many producers and directors tried to transfer the pages from the comic book onto the celluloid, but none of them succeeded, at least not until now. [Zack Snyder][3], the director of [_300_][4] and the [remade _Dawn of the Dead_][5], did what many of his predecessors had claimed to be impossible – he successfully adapted [Alan Moore's][6] masterpiece into a film.

Many people were afraid that a director of action movies filled with quick editing and slow motion scenes will not be able to handle the complexity of the graphic novel. But fortunately, neither of this came true. Snyder made a movie which does not have the need to show off and which uses slow motion shots only when it is necessary to emphasize a scene or to add a little attractiveness to the events happening on the projection screen. In short, the director made a film very different from his previous work and he still did it very well.

Snyder also likes to have not very well known actors in his films, and _Watchmen_ are not an exception to this. The actors are rather unknown, most of them have had only minor roles in minor films so far, but on the whole, the cast turned out to be very well chosen. Everybody is believable in their role and although none of the actors is acting marvelously well, you cannot blame any of them for a poor performance. The credit for the best acting job should probably go to [Jackie Earle Haley][7] who plays Rorschach in this film. Even though Haley wears a mask throughout the majority of the footage, he is able to act incredibly well even only with his voice.

Speaking about Rorschach, he is an incredibly awesome character. Although he is merciless, emotionally cold, stubborn and cynical, he is also just and all he is trying to do is to deal with the filth of society. And thanks to his costume, his mask, his cynicism and thanks to Haley of course, he keeps being absolutely cool all the time. I believe that in a couple of weeks, maybe months, the whole world – and not only the virtual one – will be full of Rorschach. And I also believe that the hardcore long-term fans of the comic book will hate the film adaptation for destroying the pleasure of their favorite novel because "every single stupid hillbilly" will talk about how much they love _Watchmen_.

Yes, _Watchmen_ are definitely going to become very popular. Snyder succeeded in pleasing all the Watchmen fans by copying panels from the comic book to the filmstrip and at the same time he also pleased people who had not been aware of the graphic novel and whose first meeting with the Watchmen phenomenon happened during the screening. People who do not know the storyline, need not to fear that they will lose the thread in the middle of the film, everything is completely understandable for everybody.

But on the other hand, _Watchmen_ are not just another superhero movie with a lot of action and no brains. The whole film requires the watcher's attention in order to understand the characters and the context of events happening. This motion picture is not about the plot at all, it is about the inner world of the characters and about the way in which the mankind thinks. And moreover, the director tried to make it also about some philosophical questions, but this one thing did not turn out very well. Doctor Manhattan thinks and talks about things which are far bigger than the problems of the mankind and the other Watchmen may also try to criticize the society, but all this looks too superficially and it does not have as powerful impact on the audience as it should have had. It is obvious that these ideas came from the original from Alan Moore, but they just did not fit into the film completely smoothly and they may appear as too shallow.

**To summarize everything, Zack Snyder surprised many people by creating a film which salutes the original graphic novel, a film which is digestible for people not aware of it too and most of all, a film which can be labeled as objectively very good.**
