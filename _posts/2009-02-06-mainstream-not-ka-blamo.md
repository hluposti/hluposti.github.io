XXX



I've recently discovered a new band. A band playing alternative rock, a band impudent enough, a band with lyrics funny enough, a band with music videos awesome enough (not the brilliant [Michel Gondry's work][2], though), a band little known enough. And when I'm listening to its music I want to jump out of the window or run away, at least. It simply meets all my criteria for a perfect band. If these information have made you curious and you'd like to know what band I'm talking about, I've got some bad news for you – I won't reveal its name.

I won't tell you the band's name because I don't want it to become known among people, to become famous, to become mainstream. This probably sounds really selfishly, but I don't care; I don't think I'd be selfish, I just don't want to lose one more thing I like.

![Try to focus on the writing, please.][pic1]

I've always enjoyed being different from others. I don't try to be different at all costs, I'm just glad when I differ from the rest of mankind in some way. And I totally hate when people start doing something I'd been doing for a long time before they even thought about it. Let me give you two examples:

1\. [Chuck Taylor All-Stars][3]. I have wanted ones since I was a child and saw them in some movies or TV shows. In my country, there was no Converse fashion until the recent years, I mean, Chuck Taylor-like shoes had been available for a really long time, but they had always been just some Chinese imitations, either in black, or in white. And furthermore, they smell really badly and when used often, they last only for a couple of weeks.

![Some well-worn Chucks. They sure have a personality.][pic2]

Some years ago I managed to buy my first regular "Chucks", red ones, and I was really proud of them and I loved to wear them all the time. But at the same exact time, a Converse boom broke out in my country and since real Chuck Taylors weren't easy to find, people began to wear those stupid Chinese fakes mentioned above. And all my pride and joy of wearing my original "Chucks" was gone.

![Emo girls wear Chucks? Now that's a surprise!][pic3]

Today, in the days of the "emo" fashion, black Chuck Taylors are a necessity for all the 15-years old girls with black make-up, dyed black hair and all-black clothes. And I, with my currently sky-blue and navy-blue ones, am trying to swim against the flow on the one hand, and on the other, I'm disgusted what kind of sick world I've gotten into.

2\. Something similar happened to my [Koss PortaPros][4] too. PortaPros are legendary headphones which have been produced since the 80's which look old school and which produce a really awesome sound (provided you like bass-friendly music). I'd been thinking about buying them for about 2 years before I finally bought them 6 months ago and back then, I was completely satisfied with them and once again I was proud to wear something that only few people have. But what a surprise it was when within one month after the buying, I started to meet about 10 different people with these headphones each week. Today the whole PortaPro mania has gone so far here that it's inevitable for me to walk across the city and not to see anybody with these headphones on his head.

![I like this pic.][pic4]

Currently, I don't wear my PortaPros in public too often in order to avoid awkward situations like "two guys with the same headphones on their heads standing next to each other in the tram" etc. And besides that, I feel too "in" when I wear them now and I don't really like to look like trying to catch up on the latest fashion.

![In or out? I don't care, for me it's just gay.][pic5]

So that's the story, I bought quite expensive headphones which I still think are awesome, but the mainstream destroyed my joy of them and now I'm able to use them happily only when there are no people around me. Not as I'd care what people think about me, I just don't want to feel awkward myself.

So that's me and the mainstream, and I could still go on giving more examples of my experiences, but it'd be no use. Sometimes I've got a feeling that I'm actually the one who dictates the new fashion and what I do decides what others will also do later and from time to time I even think that I'm the very center of everything, just like Truman Burbank from [The Truman Show][5]. And those thoughts give me the creeps.

![Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! ][pic6]

But now back to the "new band thing" – although I really hate the mainstream, I understand that bands need some money to survive, and since all their income comes from the music they make, they need to become a part of the mainstream in order to create demand for their music. I'm sure it must be really hard to decide if to become mainstream and get (loads of) money or if to stay subtle and keep the aura of exceptionality… Yeah, it's definitely a tough choice… And what would Jesus do? Well, I don't know that, but a band would certainly go for the money. That's for sure.

I've been thinking about this decision for a long time but only after finishing this post I've finally and definitely decided to support the (non-)mentioned band by ordering their album, which I've been listening to only from a not entirely legal source so far. Those guys sure deserve it.

P.S.: [Ka-Blamo?][6]
