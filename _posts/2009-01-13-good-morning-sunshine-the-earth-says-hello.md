After a couple of months, I have finally succeeded in launching this blog. The thing is that I’ve already had a blog before, but its life didn’t last for too long. It was messy and I had no exact idea what it should have been about. But my vision is clear now. Kind of…

I want to use this blog as a trash can for things I find somewhere (possibly on youtube, since the exam period has begun) and which I find interesting or for some garbage produced in my [cranium][pic1]. And I have always wanted to have a blog where I could post some movie reviews and since I have one now, maybe my wish will come true too.

I’m from a non-English speaking country (Slovakia) and I study in another non-English speaking country (Czech Republic) but I decided to run this blog in English. Why? Well, first of all, I love the English language; second, I want to improve my English and third, more people can read it when it’s in English. I don’t really believe that the third one will ever come true, I will probably even lose some of my potential Slovak and Czech readers because of their laziness, but whatever. I’ve got [Ph.D in Horribleness][pic2], I don’t need any admiration from geeks sitting in front of their computers all day long.

À propos, Ph.D in Horribleness and Doctor Horrible… Well, to be honest, I’m not Doctor Horrible. Since it’s just a fictional (and absolutely awesome) character, there is no way I could be him. So, no Ph.D in Horribleness, no Evil League of Evil and no scientist or supervillain. Those information are there, in the right column, just to confuse some accidental passers-by and to match the theme of the blog which is, as you can probably see, [Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog][2].

Despite my endless imagination I wasn’t able to come up with an original name for a blog, but then, after watching the mentioned musical, all my indecisiveness was gone. It has “blog” in it’s name, it’s quite pop cultural and [Neil Patrick Harris][3] (he’s a bit too mainstream nowadays, but still the same awesome) stars in it. Now I only hope that the missing “™”, “®” or “©” on [drhorrible.com][4] really mean that the title, the poster or anything used on this blog isn’t protected by any laws.

I’m almost done, the last thing I want to say (write) is that the blog’s theme was chosen to be the same as the genius Graham Linehan is using on his great blog called “[Why, That’s Delightful!][5]“. End of advertisement.

So this is it, we’ve reached the end of this editorial. I know it’s too long, I know I’m not funny, I know you stopped reading after or even during the first paragraph, I know the fourth season of Prison Break totally sucks… Anyway, thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoyed my tiny little introduction and most of all, I hope you’ll come again. If no, then [I Hope You Die][6].

P.S.: If I make any mistakes anywhere in my posts, feel free to criticize me or at least point it out in the comments. Thanks in advance.
