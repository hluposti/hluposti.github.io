Avatar's screenplay contains also that part of the love scene which was left out of the theatrical cut, and which should later be included on DVD/BD. And its introduction is unbelievably cheesy and sounds like an introduction to a porn video. See for yourselves:

(dialog extract)

> **Neytiri:** You are Omaticaya now. You may make own bow from the wood of Hometree. And you may choose a woman. We have many fine women. Ninat is the best singer --  
> **Jake:** I don’t want Ninat.  
> **Neytiri:** There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --  
> **Jake:** I’ve already chosen. But this woman must also choose me.  
> **Neytiri:** She already has.  
> *(they kiss)*  
> **Neytiri:** Kissing is very good. But we have something better.

WHAT?! When I'm reading those words, there's a girl pronouncing them with a strong Russian accent and unbelting a half-naked hunky guy at the same time in my head. Simply horrible.

The whole screenplay is attached below, you can find the complete “we have something better” part on pages 90-91.
